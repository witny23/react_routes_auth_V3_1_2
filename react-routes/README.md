        - Docs: https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#usenavigate
        - useNavigate instead of useHistory: https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5#use-usenavigate-instead-of-usehistory


    Use <Link /> to let the user change the URL or useNavigate to do it yourself (like after form submissions):
